<string name="app_info">Supporting things globally online is very easy and popular at the moment. There are Systems like Google+1;FaceBook Like and Flatter - to just name 3. 
Offlike aims to extend this pattern to local "offline" things. By placing QR-Codes ( or later NFC ) on real places with real problems - and giving the user the option to support this thing we hope to increase involvement with problems that matter for you - localy - offline.
