Supporting  things globally online is very easy and popular at the moment. There  are Systems like Google+1;FaceBook Like and Flatter - to just name 3. 

Offlike  aims to extend this pattern to local "offline" things. By placing  QR-Codes ( or later NFC ) on real places with real problems - and giving  the user the option to support this thing we hope to increase  involvement with problems that matter for you - localy - offline
